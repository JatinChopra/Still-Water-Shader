# ðŸ’§ Still Water Shader

A stylized **still water shader** built with Three.js and GLSL.

## ðŸ§  Background

While working on an isometric game, I wanted to create a **stepwell** with calm, stylized water. I started searching for water shader references and came across a beautiful Unity water shader that captured exactly the look I wanted.
I decided to **adapt and recreate the effect in Three.js using GLSL**.
